* What is Rethink?

Imagine is a single page theme designed for org mode exports. It currently supports latex, code blocks, lists, and tables.

* How to use

To use Rethink copy the imagine.css file into the folder you want to use it and them add the following headers to your org mode document:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="rethink.css" />
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil html-style:nil
#+END_SRC

* Syntax highlighting
Getting the syntax highlighting working can sometimes be a little difficult. The stylesheet targets html classes produced by org to style them. But, for this to work, we have to tell org that we want it to export to html with these classes. This can be done one of two ways. Globably, by adding the following to your org config

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-htmlize-output-type 'css)
#+END_SRC

or to set this locally add the following to the end of your org document(than you larstvei for recomending this):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* COMMENT Local Variables
  # Local Variables:
  # org-html-htmlize-output-type: css
  # End:
#+END_SRC

Because this code is wrapped in a COMMENT header it will not be exported. This method is in fact very flexable because you can add arbitrary elisp to the document which will run whenever the document is opened(prompting you of course, but you can tell emacs to never ask again). An excelent example of this is the following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* COMMENT Local Variables
  # Local Variables:
  # org-html-htmlize-output-type: css
  # eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-html-export-to-html nil t)
  # End:
#+END_SRC

Adding this to the end of the document will not only tell emacs to export the org document with the classes we need for code highlighting it will also tell emacs to export the document to html on every save. Which is SUPER useful.
